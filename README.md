My hand-make C-library

About
There is three basic library I made for future C projects

📘 libft - custom C library that I make from scratch.
The point is to understand memory, pointer and string functions in C standard library.
The workflow is the check the definition of each c funtion from the manual, understand it and re-implement it myself.
The library is used for all my following  C projects, and I keep reimforce it and make it more robust with the projects going on.


📄 get_next_line - Line-by-Line File Reader in C	
A low-level implementation of a function to read a file line-by-line, managing buffers and memory efficiently. Handles edge cases like newline placement and buffer overflow.

🖨️ ft_printf - Custom printf() Function in C	
A fully functional recreation of the C printf() function, supporting various format specifiers (%d, %s, %x, etc.) and flags. Built to deepen understanding of variadic functions.

born2beroot	🛡️ Linux Server Hardening (Born2BeRoot)
